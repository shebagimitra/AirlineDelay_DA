This is a project where I took a public data set from Kaggle which has data for airlines delay periods and causes in the United States from 2003 up to 2022. I took the data and analyzed it to find certain meaningful conclusions and comparisons that give the viewer a better understanding of the overall trends and outcomes of this data.
You can find this data set at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanjt/airline-delay-cause. Keep in mind that the meanings and inferences of the columns are not clear within the data set. But I did some research and made a clarified inference sheet of the data headings. It will be in a separate file in this repository.
I completed the entirety of this project using Python and its pandas module. All of the code and outcomes were made using Jupyter Notebook.
Within the documentation, you will find guided steps to recognize what's being done in each step and be able to follow along.
The outcomes I've tried to showcase are:
The number of average flight delays in 2022.
The number of average flight delays from 2003 up to 2022.
Find all the unique airlines within the entire data set.
Perform analysis on all the flight delays in the last 10 years (From 2012 to 2022) which include:
  Finding the highest number of delayed flights and their total delayed minutes.
  Found the total number of delayed flights for that airline.
  Collected a similar list for the least amount of delayed flights for an airline, keeping in mind that it wasn't a discontinued airline.
  Found the total number of delayed flights for that airline as well.
  Did a comparison between the total delayed flights of the highest number of airline delays and the lowest number of airline delays from the last two points.
  Did the same comparison, except using the highest and lowest flight delays in an airport than airlines.
  Made percentage comparisons between the sums of the highest and lowest delayed airline data and also between these and the airport data analysis made earlier.
Hopefully, these show a more insightful exploration of the data than what we can just see in the data set. All the results and conclusions of the data that I've tried to make will be present in the documentation itself. Thank you for the time to have a look at my project.
