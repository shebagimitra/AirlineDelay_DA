# AirlineDelay_DA
This is a project where I took a public data from Kaggle which has data for airlines delay periods and causes from 2003 up to 2022. I took the data and performed data analysis on it to find certain conclusions and comparisons which are meaningful and gives the viewer a better understanding of the overall trends and outcomes of this data.
